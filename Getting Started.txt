//Getting Started 
//Problem: Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).
//code:
module top_module(output one );
	assign one = 1'b1;
endmodule


//Output Zero
//Problem:  Build a circuit with no inputs and one output that outputs a constant 0
//code:
module top_module(output zero);
	assign zero =1'b0;
endmodule
